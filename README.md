## ðŸŒ‹ The Mouse is Lava

The Mouse is Lava (MIL) is a [Chrome
extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/The%20Mouse%20is%20Lava/pahaiknnkdphjllfldognhanpfblfbig)
that adds keyboard shortcuts to navigate websites with just your
keyboard. The goal of the extension is to minimize the number of times
you have to touch the mouse. Don't touch that damn mouse; it's lava.

MIL includes shortcuts that both work on every website and shortcuts for
specific, popular websites. Like Google.

Do you have an idea for a useful keyboard shortcut not yet included in
MIL? Please open an issue or a PR! ðŸ™Œ PRs always welcome.

MIL is currently in beta. But it works; I use it all day every day.
Quickstart guide:

  - Install MIL from the [Chrome Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/The%20Mouse%20is%20Lava/pahaiknnkdphjllfldognhanpfblfbig).
  - `Ctrl+B` to focus the first, or next, input element on the page.
  - `Ctrl+I` to find links in the page. It's like `Ctrl-F` but only
    finds links. Then `[enter]` to click them.
  - On Google search results pages, `[j,downArrow]` and `[k,upArrow]` to
    navigate Google search results, next and previous,
    respectively. Then `<enter>` to click them.

All keyboard shortcuts are customizable in
[chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).


### Universal Shortcuts That Work on Every Site


#### Ctrl+B - Focus First Visible Input Element

`Ctrl+B` - Focus the first, or next, visible, interactable, and
not-disabled input element in the viewport. I.e. the first interactable
`<input type="text">` element. `<textarea>` element aren't supported yet
but support is forthcoming.

The first press of `Ctrl+B` focuses the first input element in the
viewport. Subsequent presses of `Ctrl+B` iterate through successive
input elements in the viewport.

You can change the default `Ctrl+B` keybind that focuses the first input
element in
[chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).


#### Ctrl+I - Find Links and Click Them

`Ctrl+I` - Open the link search box to find clickable links in the
viewport that contain your search query. Think of the the link search
box like Chrome's `Ctrl+F` except it only finds clickable links. Why?
It's much faster to type a few characters of the link you want to click
than to move your hand to the mouse, move the mouse, click, and move
your hand back.

When the link search box is open, these additional keybinds become
active:

  - `Ctrl+J` and `Ctrl+K` - Jump to the next and previous link. VIM
    style keybinds.
  - `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` - Jump to the next and previous link.
  - `Enter` - Click the currently selected link. E.g. open the link in
    the same tab.
  - `Ctrl+Enter` - Control+click the currently selected link. E.g. open
    the link in a new tab.

You can change the default `Ctrl+I` keybind that opens the link search
box in [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).


### Google.com Shortcuts

#### Google Search Shortcuts

MIL adds keyboard shortcuts to navigate Google search results. While on
google.com search pages, these keyboard shortcuts become active:

- `j` and `<downArrow>` - Jump to the next search result.
- `k` and `<upArrow>` - Jump to the previous search result.
- `<enter>` - Navigate to the selected search result.

By default, the first Google search result is automatically selected so
you can just press `<enter>` to navigate to the first result.

#### Google Navbar Shortcuts

MIL adds keyboard shortcuts to navigate between different results
tabs. While on a Google.com search results page, these keyboard
shortcuts become available to navigate

- `a` - Load the `All` results tab.
- `n` - Load the `News` results tab.
- `i` - Load the `Images` results tab.
- `v` - Load the `Videos` results tab.
- `s` - Load the `Shopping` results tab.
- `f` - Load the `Forums` results tab.
- `w` - Load the `Web` results tab.

### Known Improvements. PRs welcome! ðŸ™Œ

- Add support for `Ctrl+B` to focus `<textarea>` elements, too. Not just
  `<input>` elements.

- Automatically click Google AI snippets `Show more` once the AI result
  is ready. Add this as an toggleable feature.

- Support finding buttons with matching text with the link finder
  box. E.g. `<input tpe='button'>text to match</input>`.
