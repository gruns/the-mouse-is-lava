================================================================================
 v0.3.0
================================================================================
added: ctrl+b now iterates through both <input> and <textarea> elements,
  not just <input> elements
changed: improved the ctrl+i link finder algorithm to find and match all
  text nodes that are on top of a clickable element in the stacking
  order. so even if the text element isn't a direct child of a clickable
  parent, the text can still be found, selected, and clicked

================================================================================
 v0.2.3
================================================================================
changed: include <input> type=[search, email, url, tel, and password] in
  ctrl+b iteration. all of those support text entry in chrome
